i'm going to write a project
where user can write, read, delete, update their note
    1. on the frontend, user have an interface
        1. create new page to write on
        2. read from existing note
            1. optionally update the note
        3. delete json page
    
    2. backend:
        1. fetch for communication between frontend and backend (need cors?)
        2. API made to handle http requests
            1. middleware (skip or use basic)
            2. rest apis
            3. routes
            4. controller (business logic)
            5. error handling (try/catch & res.status)
            6. api authentication? (optional)
            7. api validation? (optional)
    
    3. database:
        1. json as mock database


    4. other:
        1. cors for frontend/backend communication, or any that runs on 
        different port?


Client → Route → notesController → fileHandler → db.json
